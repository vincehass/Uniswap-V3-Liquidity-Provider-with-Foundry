# Uniswap-V3-Liquidity-Provider-with-Foundry
This repo is aimed to show how to develop an advanced decentralized Uniswap V3 Concentrated Liquidity Provider Range.

## Why Uniswap?
- It implements a very simple mathematical concept, `x * y = k`, which still makes it very powerful.
- It's an advanced application that has a thick layer of engineering on top of the simple formula.
- It's permissionless and battle-tested. Learning from an application that's been running in production for
several years and handling billions of dollars will make you a better developer.

## What we'll build


We'll build a full clone of Uniswap V3. It **won't be an exact copy** and it **won't be production-ready** because we'll
do something in our own way and we'll **definitely** introduce multiple bugs. So, don't deploy this to the mainnet!

While our focus will primarily be on smart contracts, we'll also build a front-end application as a side hustle. ðŸ™‚
I'm not a front-end developer and I cannot make a front-end application better than you, but I can show you how a
decentralized exchange can be integrated into a front-end application.

The full code of what we'll build is stored in a separate repository:

TBD
